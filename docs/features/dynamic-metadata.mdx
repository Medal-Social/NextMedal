# Dynamic Metadata

NextMedal lets you set custom metadata for every page and post, including the title, description, and social image. All these fields are managed visually in Sanity Studio.

- **How it works:**  
  Editors can fill out SEO fields for each page or post in Sanity Studio. The template then injects these values into the page metadata.

- **Why it matters:**  
  Custom metadata helps your content stand out in search results and on social platforms, improving click-through rates and engagement.
