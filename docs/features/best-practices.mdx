# Best Practices by Default

NextMedal is designed to help you follow SEO best practices without extra effort. The template encourages you to provide descriptive titles, concise descriptions, and social images for every page and post.

- **How it works:**  
  Sanity Studio prompts editors to fill out SEO fields, and the template validates and displays warnings for missing or suboptimal metadata.

- **Why it matters:**  
  Consistently following best practices improves your site's search ranking and makes your content more engaging for users.
