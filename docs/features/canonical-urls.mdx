# Canonical URLs

NextMedal automatically sets a canonical URL for every page and post. This tells search engines which version of a page is the preferred one, helping to prevent duplicate content issues.

- **How it works:**  
  The canonical URL is included in the page metadata, pointing to the main version of the content.

- **Why it matters:**  
  Canonical URLs help consolidate ranking signals for duplicate or similar content, improving your site's SEO.
