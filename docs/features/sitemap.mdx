# Automatic Sitemap

NextMedal automatically generates a sitemap for your site, listing all public pages and blog posts. This helps search engines discover and index your content efficiently.

- **How it works:**  
  The sitemap is generated at build time or on-demand, and is kept up to date as you add or remove content in Sanity Studio.

- **Why it matters:**  
  Sitemaps help search engines like Google and Bing find all your important content, improving your site's visibility in search results.
