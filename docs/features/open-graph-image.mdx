# Open Graph Image Generation

NextMedal ensures every page and post has a visually appealing image for social sharing. If you don't upload a social image in Sanity Studio, the template automatically generates a dynamic Open Graph (OG) image for you.

- **How it works:**  
  The OG image is included in your page metadata, so when your content is shared on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, it looks great by default.

- **Why it matters:**  
  Social platforms use OG images to create rich previews, which can increase engagement and click-through rates.
